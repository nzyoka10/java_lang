     * Java Conditions and If Statements
     *  Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

        Less than: a < b
        Less than or equal to: a <= b
        Greater than: a > b
        Greater than or equal to: a >= b
        Equal to a == b
        Not Equal to: a != b
        You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.
    
     *&   Java has the following conditional statements:
                Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
                Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
                Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
                Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
    *
