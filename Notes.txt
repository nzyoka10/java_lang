JAVA Syntax
    Main.java
        public class Main 
        {
            public static void main(String[] args) 
            {
                System.out.println("Hello World");
            }
        }

A class MUST always start with and UPPERCASE first letter.
    Eg;- Main.java

NOTE: Java is case sensitive:
    "MyClass" 
        and
    "myclass" ---> has different meaning.

The name of the java file must match the class name.

## The main Method
    public static void main(String[] args)
        This method is where the program starts executing from when you run a Java application. 
        It's called by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
        - String[] args : An array of strings that contains the command line arguments passed to the program. If no arguments are provided, it will be an empty array.

    - Main() method is required & used in every Java program.

    System.out.println()
        Used to display any output on console.
        Example:
        // System.out.println("Hello World");

Java Output / Print
    Print Text
    - println() method is used to output values 
        Example
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
            System.out.println("I am learning Java.");
            System.out.println("It is awesome!");
    
    Double Quotes
    - When you are working with text, it must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".
    - If you forget the double quotes, an error occurs:
        System.out.println("This sentence will work!"); // correct 
        System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error); // error occurs

The Print() Method
    There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().
        The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:
            Example
            System.out.print("Hello World! ");
            System.out.print("I will print on the same line.");
    
    Java Comments
        Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. 
            It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
            1. Single Line Comments start with two slash characters //.
                Example: 
                    // This is a single-line comment.
                        int x = 5;   // Another single-line comment.

            2. Multi-Line Comments start with /* and end with */.
                Example:  
                    /*  
                    * This is a multi-line comment.
                    * You can write as many lines as you want.
                    * Even without adding anything between them.
                    */
            
Java identifiers 
    All java variables must be identified with unique names
      the unique names are called identifiers.

    They can be short like; i, j, x or more 
       descriptive names like; age, sum, price etc.
    NOTE: It's recommended to use descriptive names in order to create  understandable code 
                and maintainable code.
